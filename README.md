# recyclerview-grid-quickreturn

An example of implementing QuickReturn on a RecyclerView 
using a StaggeredGridLayoutManager to display CardViews inside a SwipeRefreshLayout.

This is an example project that shows one approach (probably not the best one!) of 
implementing the QuickReturn pattern with a RecyclerView that uses the
StaggeredGridLayoutManager.  For grins, the whole thing also supports Pull-to-Refresh
using a SwipeRefreshLayout. By the way, the cells within the layout are CardViews, and use 
the `card_view:cardUseCompatPadding="true"` attribute to display properly on Lollipop.

The idea is that the QR view should not cover the top items in the RV.  This is now accomplished with a custom
(but trivial) ItemDecoration.  As a result, the adapter and layoutmanager are plain vanilla.  I'm sure there's
a better way, so if you find it, please explain it to me!  :-)

Here's what it looks like with expandable cells:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ulf4v3Qzn4o

Here's an older animation:

## Changes
1. (2015-1-2) Added TargetedSwipeRefreshLayout (TSRL) to permit multiple views within the SwipeRefreshLayout.
1. (2015-1-2) Removed topview detection from onScrollListener (no longer needed with TSRL).
2. (2014-11-14) Modified the spacing hack to use an ItemDecorator (cleaner approach).

## TODO
1. (2014-11-14) ~~It's been suggested that I look into using ItemDecoration instead of adjusting cell margins during onBind.~~
2. (2015-03-18) Fixed using recyclerview-v7 R22 ~~Need to address issue of inserting items at top of grid.~~
